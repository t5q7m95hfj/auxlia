      <h1>Who is behind Auxlia</h1>
      <p>
        Auxlia was created by Joseph, a traveler and anthropologist who has spent years guiding people
        through airports, train stations, and unfamiliar cities. The service grew out of watching how calm,
        clear information can quietly change a journey.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="founder-card">
      <h2>A background in people, not just places</h2>
      <p>
        Joseph studied anthropology with a focus on how people live, relate, and communicate in the present.
        Over time, this turned toward digital life and the ways people turn to technology when they feel
        vulnerable or alone. That same curiosity now sits at the core of Auxlia.
      </p>
      <p>
        In parallel, Joseph has worked in tourism and travel logistics: welcoming groups at airports,
        helping travelers find the right platform, and staying with them when things did not go to plan.
        The combination of fieldwork, listening, and on the ground experience shaped Auxlia into a service
        that is practical and human at the same time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="founder-card">
      <h2>Why this kind of support</h2>
      <p>
        Again and again, the same pattern appeared. The itinerary was solid, the tickets were booked,
        and yet people still felt unsettled. It was not because they were unable to travel. It was because
        modern traveling asks people to manage many small, easily underestimated moments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Auxlia was created for those moments. It is a way to offer the same steady presence that Joseph has
        provided for years in person, but in a form that can reach people wherever they are.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="founder-card">
      <h2>Anthropology as a quiet backbone</h2>
      <p>
        Anthropology reminds us that no two travelers carry the same history, fears, or expectations.
        It teaches patience with difference and attention to context. It keeps the focus on listening
        before offering advice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Auxlia is an independent project, built slowly and with care. It is one way of bringing social
        science into everyday life rather than keeping it locked in academic circles.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="founder-card">
      <h2>In plain terms</h2>
      <p>
        Joseph has often been the person family, friends, and strangers turn to when traveling feels like
        too much. Auxlia is a way of making that calm presence available to others, in a structured and
        transparent way.

        or simply write a short email describing your trip and what feels heavy. A human will read it and respond.
