    <h1>Who is behind Auxlia</h1>
    <p>
      Auxlia was created by Joseph Markman, a traveler and digital
      anthropologist who has spent years guiding people through airports, train
      stations, and unfamiliar cities. The service grew out of watching how
      calm, clear information can change a journey.
    </p>

      <h2>A background in people, not just places</h2>
      <p>
        Joseph studied anthropology with a focus on how people live, relate,
        and communicate in the present. Over time this turned toward digital
        life and the ways people turn to technology when they feel vulnerable
        or alone. That same curiosity now sits at the core of Auxlia.
      </p>
      <p>
        In parallel, Joseph has worked in tourism and travel logistics,
        welcoming groups at airports, helping travelers find the right
        platform, and staying with them when things did not go to plan. The
        combination of fieldwork, listening, and on the ground experience shaped
        Auxlia into a service that is practical and human at the same time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="founder-section founder-highlight">
      <h2>Why this kind of support</h2>
      <p>
        Again and again, Joseph saw the same pattern. The itinerary was solid,
        the tickets were booked, and yet people still felt unsettled. It was
        not because they were unable to travel. It was because modern
        traveling asks people to manage many small moments that are easy to
        underestimate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Auxlia was created for those moments. It is a way to offer the same
        steady presence that Joseph has provided for years in person, but in a
        form that can reach people wherever they are.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="founder-section">
      <h2>Anthropology as a quiet backbone</h2>
      <p>
        Anthropology informs Auxlia in simple but important ways. It reminds us
        that no two travelers carry the same history, fears, or expectations.
        It teaches patience with difference and attention to context. It keeps
        the focus on listening before giving advice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Auxlia is an independent project. It is built slowly, with care, and
        with an interest in applying social science to everyday life rather
        than keeping it locked in academic circles.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="founder-section founder-cta">
      <h2>In plain terms</h2>
      <p>
        Joseph has often been the person family, friends, and strangers turn to
        when travel feels like too much. Auxlia is a way of making that calm
        presence available to others, in a structured and transparent way.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are curious about working with Auxlia, you can read the
        Services and FAQ pages, or simply write a short email describing your
        trip and what feels heavy. A human will read it and respond.
