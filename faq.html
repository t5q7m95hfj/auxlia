    <!-- FAQ CONTENT -->
    <main class="faq-content">

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How does Auxlia work?</h3>
        <p>
          Auxlia offers travel support tailored to your needs, from planning to
          coming home. You choose the level of support you want, from light
          reassurance to fuller accompaniment, and we help you through the
          moments you did not plan for.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is included in each tier?</h3>
        <p>
          All tiers begin with a preparation call and check-ins set around your
          comfort level. Light support offers minimal guidance and a few check-ins.
          Steady support adds ongoing assistance while you are abroad. Full support
          offers deeper, more regular contact as your journey unfolds.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How does pricing work?</h3>
        <p>
          Auxlia uses a transparent retainer model. You agree to a starting
          amount based on the tier you choose. We draw from it only when you ask
          for help. Anything unused can be refunded, passed to a trusted person,
          or kept as credit. Prices are listed in euros (&euro;) with approximate
          dollar equivalents, and final charges in other currencies adjust to
          the rate at the time of payment.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do I need Auxlia for my whole trip?</h3>
        <p>
          Not necessarily. Some travelers only want support on arrival day.
          Others prefer check-ins throughout a longer itinerary. We can focus on
          specific legs of your trip, or stay available in the background from
          start to finish.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Are you travel agents?</h3>
        <p>
          Not in the usual sense. We can help you think through plans, compare
          options, and sometimes assist with bookings. The heart of Auxlia is
          support for the emotional and practical weight of traveling, not
          selling packages.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Are you available worldwide?</h3>
        <p>
          Auxlia operates digitally anywhere you can reach us. Human on the
          ground assistance currently focuses on major European and American
          hubs, with possible expansion as our network grows.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What happens if something unexpected happens?</h3>
        <p>
          This is where Auxlia is most useful. If you face cancellations, delays,
          confusing instructions, or simple overwhelm, we help you slow down,
          understand what is happening, and decide what to do next. We do not
          replace emergency services, but we help you feel less alone while you
          deal with them.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Are you a crisis or emergency line?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Auxlia does not provide medical, legal, or safety interventions,
          and we do not operate as an emergency hotline. In urgent situations,
          you should contact local emergency services first. We can help you
          find the right contact details, think through next steps, and
          communicate with trusted people once immediate safety is addressed.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Are you a therapy or mental health service?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Auxlia is not a therapy service and does not replace a therapist,
          counsellor, or other mental health professional. We focus on the emotional
          side of traveling by listening, helping you think through options, and
          offering steady reassurance. If you are already in care, we encourage you
          to keep your therapist and use Auxlia as an extra layer of support around
          your trip.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What do you not support?</h3>
        <p>
          Auxlia does not support travel that involves war zones, unsafe conflict
          areas, exploitation, or harm to others. We also do not assist with
          activities such as sex tourism, hunting, or travel that puts you at clear
          and serious risk. If you are unsure, you can ask us, and we will tell you
          honestly what falls outside our scope.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do I need internet or phone access to use Auxlia?</h3>
        <p>
          Auxlia works best when you have reliable access to email and basic
          messaging. Most support happens through written communication, so a
          working connection is important. If your connection is unstable, we will
          do our best, but there are limits to what we can offer if we cannot hear
          from you regularly while you are traveling.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Which languages do you work in?</h3>
        <p>
          We currently work in English and French. You can write to us in either
          language, and we will respond in the same. In the future, we may add
          more languages as the team grows, but we prefer to keep the service
          clear and careful rather than stretch beyond what we can handle well.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What does "Auxlia" mean?</h3>
        <p>
          It comes from the Latin "auxilium," meaning help or support, and from the French "auxiliaire," which means a helper. 
          The name points to what Auxlia aims to be: someone to be beside you when travel feels uncertain.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Who is Auxlia for?</h3>
        <p>
          Auxlia is for people who can plan a trip, but feel the weight of it.
          You might be an experienced traveler who wants a calm presence in the
          background, or someone who feels overwhelmed by the small decisions that
          pile up. We focus on states of mind rather than labels, and we welcome
          solo travelers, couples, families, and friends who value steadiness and
          clear communication.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How far in advance should I contact you?</h3>
        <p>
          Ideally, you reach out a few weeks before you travel so we can set
          expectations, agree on a tier, and plan the first calls. We may still
          be able to help closer to departure, but the scope may need to be
          smaller and there may be a late-start limit on what we can take on.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Where can I read your full values and boundaries?</h3>
        <p>
          We keep a clear, written overview of what Auxlia does and does not do,
          how we communicate, and how we handle limits, safety, and money.
