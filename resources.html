        These tools can help ground you.
        They are not medical advice or therapy, just simple ways to pause,
        breathe, and check in with yourself.

          If everything feels a bit too much, you can use this circle as a gentle guide.
          You do not have to count or get it perfect. Just follow along.
        </p>

            <p><strong>Exhale</strong> as it slowly softens back in.</p>
            <p>
              Try a few rounds. If you lose the rhythm, it is alright.
              You can always start again.

      <!-- Grounding prompts -->
      <article class="resources-card">
        <h2>Grounding prompts</h2>
        <p>
          These questions are meant to bring you back to the present moment,
          especially in waiting rooms, stations, lines, or long walks.
        </p>
        <ul class="resources-list">
          <li>What is one thing I can feel with my hands right now?</li>
          <li>What are three colors I can see around me?</li>
          <li>What is one sound I can hear, close or far away?</li>
          <li>Is there a surface I can lean on or sit against for support?</li>
          <li>What would “a slightly easier next step” look like from here?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can screenshot or write these down before you travel and keep them
          somewhere easy to reach.

<!-- Gentle visual game -->
<article class="resources-card">
  <h2>Follow the line</h2>
  <p>
    This is a small visual game for moments of waiting. It is not about doing it
    perfectly, just giving your eyes and mind one simple thing to follow.
  </p>
  <div class="focus-block">
    <div class="focus-track">
      <div class="focus-dot"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="focus-prompts">
      <p><strong>How to use it:</strong></p>
      <p>Let your eyes follow the dot as it moves from side to side.</p>
      <p>Try to notice one small thing around you: a color, a sound, a shape.</p>
      <p>If your attention drifts, that's OK. Just slowly come back to the dot.</p>

      <!-- Before you travel checklist -->
      <article class="resources-card">
        <h2>Before you travel</h2>
        <p>
          A short list to help you feel a little more prepared. It is not exhaustive,
          but it can catch some details that add quiet stress later on.
        </p>
        <ul class="resources-list">
          <li>Keep copies of key documents (ID, tickets, bookings) in one place.</li>
          <li>Note down important addresses and booking references offline.</li>
          <li>Save local emergency numbers and your lodging contact.</li>
          <li>Check how your phone will work abroad and any roaming limits.</li>
          <li>Pack any daily medication in your carry-on, not only in checked bags.</li>
          <li>Choose one person at home who knows your rough itinerary.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you work with Auxlia, we can help you adapt this list to your
          specific trip.

      <!-- When you feel overwhelmed -->
      <article class="resources-card">
        <h2>When it feels like too much</h2>
        <p>
          There may be moments when the weight of traveling feels heavier than expected.
          A missed connection, a long delay, or a sudden change can stir up more than logistics.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are in immediate danger or having a medical or mental health emergency,
          contact local emergency services first. They are the ones best placed to respond in that moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          After safety is handled, it can help to:
        </p>
        <ul class="resources-list">
          <li>Reach out to someone you trust and let them know where you are.</li>
          <li>Use a small ritual, like drinking water or washing your hands.</li>
          <li>Return to one simple task: find a seat, read one sign, send one message.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Auxlia can offer emotional and practical support around these moments,
          but we do not replace crisis lines, therapists, or medical care.
