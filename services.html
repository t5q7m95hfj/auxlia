        <p class="retainer-text">
          Auxlia works on a transparent retainer model. You load an amount that fits your trip. Part of it covers our time, and the rest sits as credit for you.  
          If you don't use the full amount, the remainder is refunded or carried forward to a future journey or someone you choose.
          
          <br> <br> *Prices are listed in euros (€). Dollar (USD/$) amounts are approximate and adjusted at the time of payment.
