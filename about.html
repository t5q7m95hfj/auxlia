      <!-- WHAT AUXLIA IS -->
      <div class="about-card">
        <h2>What Auxlia is</h2>
        <p>
Auxlia helps you stay oriented while you travel. We clarify what is happening when timing, instructions, or plans feel unclear, focusing on the practical parts of travel that are easy to misread: procedures, signs, connections, and unexpected changes. We help you understand the situation and choose your next step with a calmer pace.
        </p>
      </div>


      <!-- WHAT AUXLIA IS NOT -->
      <div class="about-card">
        <h2>What Auxlia is not</h2>
        <p>
Auxlia is here to assist you, but we do not provide medical, legal, or psychological services. We do not replace emergency hotlines, insurance, consular services, or local authorities. Our support offers calm orientation and practical guidance within clear limits, not emergency response or 24/7 availability.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- MINI FAQ -->
      <div class="about-card">
        <h2>Short answers</h2>

        <h3 class="mini-faq-q">Can you book travel?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. We can help with bookings and practical planning. We are not traditional travel
          agents and we do not sell packages, but we can assist with logistics, feasibility,
          cultural context, and choosing options that align with your plans.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mini-faq-q">How does communication work?</h3>
        <p>
          Most communication takes place in written form: email, text messages, or voice notes.
          We agree on communication windows and preferences in advance so expectations are clear.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mini-faq-q">Do you work worldwide?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. We can support you wherever you have internet access. On-the-ground familiarity is
          strongest in Europe and North America.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mini-faq-q">What can I rely on Auxlia for?</h3>
        <p>
          Calm, balanced interpretation of moments that feel unclear (timing, instructions,
          procedures, and unexpected changes) to help you navigate your travels more steadily.
        </p>

        <p>
          We offer guidance through uncertainty while respecting your autonomy. Our work stays
          practical through orientation, interpretation, and steadiness, not emergency
