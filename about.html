      <h1>About Auxlia</h1>
      <p>
        Auxlia exists for travelers who can plan a trip, but feel the weight of it.
        We sit in the space between logistics and feelings so you do not have to carry it all alone.
      </p>

        <h2>What Auxlia is</h2>
        <p>
          Auxlia is a travel support service that focuses on the emotional and practical side of
          traveling. We are not here to push packages or rush you through decisions. We stay close
          to the parts that feel heavy, unclear, or quietly stressful and help you move through
          them at a human pace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes that means helping you plan in a calmer way before you leave.
          Sometimes it means being present in the background while you are already on the move,
          so you know there is someone steady you can turn to when plans shift.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="about-card">
        <h2>Who Auxlia helps</h2>
        <p>
          Auxlia is built around states of mind, not categories. People turn to Auxlia when they
          feel overloaded by details, anxious about making the wrong choice, or tired of holding
          the whole plan in their head.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might be a confident traveler who simply wants a calm presence to lean on.
          You might be traveling alone, juggling care for others, or returning to traveling after a
          long break. What you have in common is not a label, but a wish to feel more grounded,
          understood, and supported while you move through the world.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="about-card">
        <h2>How Auxlia works in practice</h2>
        <p>
          Every collaboration starts with a simple exchange. You tell us your travel dates,
          where you are going, and what feels hardest to hold on your own. Together we decide
          on a level of support, from light check-ins to steady accompaniment across your trip.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use a clear retainer model with transparent pricing. You know in advance what is
          covered, what is not, and how to reach us. We do not replace emergency services or
          medical care, and we do not pretend to. Instead, we help you slow down, understand
          what is happening, and take your next step with less panic and more clarity.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="about-card">
        <h2>Anthropology at the core</h2>
        <p>
          Auxlia is rooted in anthropology, the study of how people live, relate, and make sense
          of their lives. Here, anthropology is not an abstract theory. It is a way of paying
          careful attention to what traveling actually feels like in the present moment, and how
          support can meet people where they are instead of where they are expected to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          That lens shapes how we listen, how we design the service, and how we talk about traveling.
          We treat your experience as something worth understanding in its own right, not as a set
          of data points or sales leads.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="about-card">
        <h2>Who is behind Auxlia</h2>
        <p>
          Auxlia was created by a traveler and digital anthropologist who has spent years helping
          others navigate airports, stations, and the quiet stresses that sit between each step.
          The service is an extension of that work, turned into a clearer structure that can
          support more people without losing its human tone.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would like to learn more about the person behind Auxlia, you will be able to read
          the founder story in more detail soon. For now, what matters most is simple. You are not
          expected to handle every part of traveling alone.
